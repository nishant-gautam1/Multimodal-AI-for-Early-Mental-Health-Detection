# Multimodal-AI-for-Early-Mental-Health-Detection
This project proposes the development of an AI system that leverages text, audio, and facial data to detect early signs of mental health issues. The system will be developed using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches, with models trained on open-source datasets.
