# Multimodal-AI-for-Early-Mental-Health-Detection
Abstract:

Mental health disorders such as stress, anxiety, and depression are growing concerns worldwide, particularly among students and young adults. Early detection can play a critical role in prevention and treatment. This project proposes the development of an AI system that leverages text, audio, and facial data to detect early signs of mental health issues. The system will be developed using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches, with models trained on open-source datasets. A Flask backend and web-based frontend will enable real-time predictions, while a database will store inputs and outputs. This system aims to provide an accessible, technology-driven solution for early screening, thereby contributing to preventive mental health care.

Problem Statement:

There is a lack of accessible, real-time, and automated systems for early mental health detection. Existing solutions are either limited to research or single modalities (only text or only face). A multimodal, AI-driven solution is needed to enhance reliability and accessibility.
